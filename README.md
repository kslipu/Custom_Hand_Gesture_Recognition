## Custom Hand Gesture Recognition
->> This project uses MediaPipe Hands and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to recognize custom hand gestures in real-time. The system allows you to collect gesture data, train a machine learning model, and perform real-time gesture recognition using a webcam.

->> Certainly! there is the content for a requirements.txt file that you can use to install the necessary dependencies for custom hand gesture recognition project.

->> To install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, run the following command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

->> Clone my repose or download the repose in zip format to get all these documents and code.
